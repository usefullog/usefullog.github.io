### Tech Logs

 - 2024-05-04 Adding photos took from the Chicago trip but Github would not let me push the commit. It took me a while to root cause the [problem](https://confluence.atlassian.com/stashkb/git-push-fails-fatal-the-remote-end-hung-up-unexpectedly-282988530.html). Turns out that I need to set the POST buffer size larger than 1MB. ```git config --global http.postBuffer 5000000```  

 - 2024-07-13 Adding Saguaro NP and Glacier NP.  
 - 2024-10-06 Add Camera post.
