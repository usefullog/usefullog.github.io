Birthplace of California -- before I visited this city, I have been hearing good thing about San Diego. The perfect weather, good food, and fun activities. One thing I did not know before my trip, is that it is also an old city. In fact, the Old Town San Diego is referred to as the "birthplace" of California.

The yard in La Casa de Estudillo, the iconic building in the old town plaza. White wall, red pottery roof tile, cactus and a resting rabbit. Apparently the rabbits live here and don't mind people walking around their home.

Brunch at The Congress Cafe in Old Town. La de Mano, the sweet corn pancake with Venezuelan white cheese - queso de mano - meaning "the hand cheese" in Spainish. Filled with cheese, beans and plantain, it was a perfect brunch.

Art Studio in Balboa Park -- I have been always curious about how people buying artwork while traveling. Mostly I want to know how does it feel like when you see some art and know that you have to take it with you. In San Diego I finally bought my first artwork while I was on the road. I met the artist Deb Gargula and had a brief conversation with her at the Spanish Village Art Center in Balboa Park. I loved the delicate color pencil drawings of Arizona cactus desert landscape. I had to carry the drawing on the flight home and it was an amazing experience.  

If you are into art, Balboa Park is definitely worth a visit. In addition to the art studios, the architecture of the museum buildings and the landscape design are outstanding.

I was on a constant search for great tacos since I moved to the West Coast. Without doing any research, I decided to try the taco restaurant right across the street from my hotel. Tacos El Gordo in Downtown San Diego is very busy. They have a huge shawarma-style grill for pork adobada. Various beef asada selections. The store was crowded and the ordering lines were a little confusing. But oh my gosh -- the taco is super-duper good!
