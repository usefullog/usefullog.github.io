# Elon Musk’s 5-step Engineering Process

During an interview with Tim Dodd of Everyday Astronaut at SpaceX’s Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, Elon Musk outlined his 5-step engineering process for optimizing design and manufacturing. These steps, which must be followed in order, are designed to streamline innovation and reduce unnecessary complexity at SpaceX and Tesla.

1. **Make Requirements Less Dumb**  
   - Question every requirement, regardless of who provided it, as all requirements are prone to error.  
   - Requirements from intelligent people are especially dangerous, as they may not be scrutinized enough.  
   - Each requirement must be tied to a specific person, not a department, to ensure accountability and clarity.  
   - Musk’s philosophy: “Everyone’s wrong some of the time,” and all designs have flaws—it’s a matter of degree.

2. **Delete Unnecessary Parts or Processes**  
   - Aggressively eliminate parts or processes unless absolutely essential.  
   - If you’re not adding back at least 10% of deleted elements, you’re not deleting enough.  
   - Resist the bias to add components or steps “just in case” they’re needed.  
   - Example: SpaceX removed the pushing separation system for stage separation, using main booster engines and cold gas thrusters instead.

3. **Simplify and Optimize**  
   - Only after deleting unnecessary elements should you simplify and optimize what remains.  
   - A common mistake is optimizing something that shouldn’t exist, wasting time and resources.  
   - Musk warns against the “mental straightjacket” of traditional education, where engineers are trained to answer questions without challenging their validity.

4. **Accelerate Cycle Time**  
   - Speed up processes, but only after completing the first three steps.  
   - Musk cautions: “If you’re digging your grave, don’t dig it faster.” Accelerating a flawed process is counterproductive.  
   - Example: Musk admitted to prematurely accelerating processes in Tesla’s Model 3 production, leading to inefficiencies.

5. **Automate**  
   - Automation is the final step, applied only after requirements are questioned, unnecessary elements are deleted, and processes are simplified.  
   - Automating too early can entrench wasteful processes. Musk cited automating a Tesla Model 3 battery mat production that was later deemed unnecessary.  
   - Remove in-process testing once issues are resolved, as it slows production if acceptance rates are high.

# Key Takeaways  
- Musk emphasizes the strict order of these steps to avoid common engineering pitfalls, such as optimizing or automating processes that shouldn’t exist in the first place.  
- The process reflects his philosophy of First Principles Thinking, challenging assumptions, and focusing on simplicity and efficiency.  
- Applied rigorously at SpaceX and Tesla, this methodology supports rapid innovation, as seen in Starship development and cost reductions for Raptor engines (targeting under $1,000 per ton of thrust).
