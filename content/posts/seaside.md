Oregon beach is cold even in summer. There is often strong wind and the sea water is freezing. Nevertheless, the sand is very soft on Oregan beaches and I still enjoy walking on the beach and into the waves, even in the winter.

Seaside carousel mall. Vintage is the highlight of Seaside. Everything in this town feels nostalgic. Seaside is also the end of the Lewis & Clark trail.

This tilt-a-whirl is not functional. I liked the colorful lighting and painting. This place reminds me of the abandoned funhouse scene in the PC game Max Payne 2 - one of the most classic franchises.

The karting game is still popular!
