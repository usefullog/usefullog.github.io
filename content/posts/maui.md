Maui is the second island I visited in Hawaii. Driving up to Haleakala National Park and watch the sunrise. At 10,023 feet, it is the highest peak in Maui. Reservation is required to enter the park.

The sunrise moment is the highlight of this Maui trip.  As people are waiting for the sunrise, a park ranger sang the Hawaiian sunrise chant "E Ala E", meaning "awaken", to welcome the sun.

Haleakala Observatory bathed in the glorious golden sunlight. Sometimes I wonder how would it feel like working in a remote mountain top research facility. It could be nice for an introvert.

Beautiful chickens roaming around in Hawaii.

A lot of sea turtles found at Ho'okipa Beach Park. The sea turtles are really bigger than what I imagined. They move very slowly on the beach but they are agile in the water. We met two sea turtles swimming along our kayak the next day.

Ground squirrel near the Black Sand Beach. It is not easy to reach Black Sand Beach becuase Road to Hana is super windy and narrow with both directions using a single lane. It is definitely not a relaxing driving experience.
