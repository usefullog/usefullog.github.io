Maui is the second island I visited in Hawaii. Driving up to Haleakala National Park and watch the sunrise. At 10,023 feet, it is the highest peak in Maui. Reservation is required to enter the park.

A lot of sea turtles found at Ho'okipa Beach Park.

Ground squirrel near the Black Sand Beach. It is not easy to reach Black Sand Beach becuase Road to Hana is super windy and narrow with both directions using a single lane. It is definitely not a relaxing driving experience.
