# Coffee on top of Taipei 101
My friend introduced me to Simple Kaffa in Taipei. The brand was established by Wu after he won the World Barista Championship in 2016. Simple Kaffa offers gourmet coffee beans from rare source in small batches. Most interestingly, it serves coffee that is grown locally in Taiwan.  

Simple Kaffa has multiple locations, and this one - Simple Kaffa Sola - is on the 88th floor of Taipei 101. To reach here, you will enter Taipei 101 from the office entrance (not the shopping mall side) and talk to the reception desk.

Sitting by the window facing north; you can see Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall, Taipei Dome, and Taipei Songshan Airport. If you don't work here at Taipei 101, this gorgeous view is very enjoyable and worth the minimal spending requirement. Outstanding coffee roasted and brewed with high standard. The desserts are impressive, too.

# North East Coast   

Beiguan was established a fort in the Qing dynasty of China. You can still see ancient battery guns located in the park. This is a loop trail in the park for an easy walk. Back when I was living in Taiwan, Yilan was a place I rarely visit.

# Food highlights

Open by Russian immigrants who fled Shanghai in 1949, Cafe Astoria is a place filled with nostalgic atmosphere. Even the food has a familiar flavor that resembles a localized western style dining. I am talking about the black pepper sauce that has become indispensable partner of the steak. This place served many famous people including politicians, artists, writers and poets.

Beyondmilk - soybean pudding, peanuts, walnut with sesame soymilk.  

![Chicken Bento](/taiwan/takeda-chicken.JPG)  

Chicken Bento (武田雞肉) - lunchbox tastes better in a round-shape container. This bento is no-nonsense and straight awesome. Green onion oil sauce on tender chichen, soy-braised fried meatball and tofu -- yummy, yummy and yummy.  

![Rice noodle](/taiwan/rice-noodle.JPG)  
During a visit to Kaohsiung, my aunt and uncle brought me here for squid rice noodle soup (阿忠米粉湯). This place offers local southern Taiwanese style flavors, such as the milkfish skin and the shark meat.
