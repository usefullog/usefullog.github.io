Glacier National Park is very popular and extremely difficult to book. I was very lucky to able to go there, thanks to P's perfect planning one year in advance. We stayed in Kalispell and entered from West Glacier.

We sat by the Bowman Lake and did nothing - just watch people and enjoy the time. It could be one of the most relaxing experience. There were people skipping pebbles. One kid was really good and all proud of himself, until he saw another guy throwing twice as many skips. I also met a bird, don't know its species, jumping really close to my lap -- then it pulled a green worm out of the sand from under my lap.

We rode on a rubber boat peacefully floating through a river. This is in West Glacier before entering the National Park.

Lake McDonald Lodge looks very rustic from the outside but it had some update on its bathroom, which is quite nice.

Beargrass along the Iceberg Lake Trail. Someone saw a black bear on this trail, and the next day this trail was closed. Iceberg Lake Trail lenght = 9.6 mi, elevation gain = 1459 ft.

The quickest way to reach Grinnell Glacier Trailhead is by taking the Morning Eagle boat, built in 1945, going across the Lake Josephine.

Grinnell Lake is an alpine lake with milky green color.

It was an achievement for me to complete the Grinnell Glacier Trail. It was challenging but also very rewarding. I saw several bighorn sheeps along the way. There was also a team of rangers camping there and working on the trail pavement construction - respect! The glacier lake water is very cold and refreshing. Grinnell Glacier Trail length = 10.0 mi, elevation gain = 2047 ft. We did the Iceberg and the Grinnell back-to-back in two days.
