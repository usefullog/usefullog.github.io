I got my first "real" camera in 2024 - a camera with a detachable lens and adjustable aperture and shutter speed; it is a Sony a6700 mirrorless. I used point-and-shoot camera growing up when films were the only way to record photos. I remember that people would worry about their films getting exposed under X-ray luggage scanner. Entering the digital age, I owned a golden Sony CyberShot point-and-shoot. Then I skipped the entire the DSLR age by exclusively using iPhone to take photos. Perhaps it is the first time I felt that the photo can be aesthetic, in addition to being the practical recording media that captures an event.

Multnomah Falls is a very popular attraction in Oregon. Most people just stop at the bottom of the falls and take pictures. Some people would hike to the top of the falls and return, which was what I did. This time, however, I went along the Larch Mountain Trail and found Wiesendanger Falls. Significantly fewer people actually walked here, although it was not very far from the top of the Multnomah Falls.

Still learning photography skills. Trying to lower the shutter speed such that the waterfall looks silky and flowing.
