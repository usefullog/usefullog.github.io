# Birthplace of California   
Before I visited this city, I have been hearing good thing about San Diego. The perfect weather, good food, and fun activities. One thing I did not know before my trip, is that it is also an old city. In fact, the Old Town San Diego is referred to as the "birthplace" of California.

The yard in La Casa de Estudillo, the iconic building in the old town plaza. White wall, red pottery roof tile, cactus and a resting rabbit. Apparently the rabbits live here and don't mind people walking around their home.

Brunch at The Congress Cafe in Old Town. La de Mano, the sweet corn pancake with Venezuelan white cheese - queso de mano - meaning "the hand cheese" in Spainish. Filled with cheese, beans and plantain, it was a perfect brunch.
