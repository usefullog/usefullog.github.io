I live among tall trees in Oregon. Conifers in my backyard are easily taller than a 3-story house and I am so used to seeing and walking amongst these tall trees. The trees in the Redwood National Park, however, are beyond my imagination.

Dean Creek Elk Viewing Area. We saw a large group of elks here. This is on Umpqua highway along the Umpqua River, near Reedsport in Oregon.

After a brief stop at Hiouchi Visitor Center, we went on to visit giant trees at Stout Grove Trail, near  and Jedediah Smith Campground. This is the north part of the Redwood National Park. Standing among the trees, it is hard to tell how tall the tree is. You cannot see the top of the tree. The width of the tree is also mind-blowingly huge.

Seabird at Crecent City Harbor. There are a lot of critters and nature happening here. I saw a ground squirrel digging holes. A lot of crabs and hermit crabs on the intertidal zone. A seabird picking a fish out of the sea water.

Seabird with the Battery Point Lighthouse in the background. People can walk to the lighthouse during the low tide. I was able to return before the sea water submerged the road.

Crescent City is a good place to stay the night. Check out SeaQuake Brewing for dinner. Paragon Coffeehouse serves really good coffee.

We also stayed in a very small village called Klamath. It is a nice location where you can have a shorter drive to the south part of the Redwood National Park.

Karl Knapp Trail near Praire Creek Visitor Center. This leads to the famous Big Tree. The ferns and the woods form a prehistoric theme, just like in Jurassic Park.

I found this downed tree with a blackened bark on the Trillium Falls trail. Under the morning sun in the misty air, you can see the vapor rising from the wood surface. I am trying to capture the vapor in the photo, and it is quite difficult.

Fern Canyon is the highlight of Redwood National Park. Narrow canyon with windy creek through it. The rock walls on both sides are covered with green lush ferns. Water droplets falling down from the fern leaves. This is like a secret place in your dream, except it is super popular and you need a permit to enter. Driving across some small creek is also part of the fun.
