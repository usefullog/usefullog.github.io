Visiting Saguaro National Park is like visiting another world - it is beyond my imagination. It took a decade for a Saguaro cactus to grow a few inches tall, and yet there is a forest full of giant, 3-story tall Saguaro in front of me.  Think about how long does it take to grow this vast landscape of cactus.

Saguaro cactus has a wax-like texture skin with deep groove on its surface. When it takes more water in, the body will expand and the grooves become shallower. It is a very delicate mechanism to store water.

Arizona is really hot in the summar. Spring would be a nice season to visit and I went there in March and saw wild flowers along the trail. The Saguaro cactus is massive and that means it started growing long time ago. It is almost a miracle to live such a long life. The naturalists have done a good job to protest the amazing landscape.

A *forest* of Saguaro covers the entire hill, it is a dense forest but the space between two cacti is quite larger than in a normal tree forest. This is because the root of a Saguaro reaches far out. The scene feels unreal.

At Signal Hill, in the Saguaro NP West. There is a site where you can find prehistoric drawings on the rocks called petroglyphs.

Walking among various cacti and occasionally you can get a prickly thumb :P.
