This year I started several projects for my personal growth.

# Learn about cryptocurrency 
I played with mining crypto during Covid-19 purely just for fun and the technical aspect of the blockchain. After a few month I got bored and later the entire crypto fever was cooled down. Until recently I was inspired by my cousin who had bought bitcoin and had crypto exchange account for many years. Then I tried to educate myself and understand the logic behind owning bitcoin. It all makes sense now, although I am a little too late in the game. I am still excited about the technology of the blockchain, but now I also see bitcoin as a way to preserve my purchase power and other blockchain as a new way to do transaction with lower cost.

# Learn about AI
I learned and understand machine learning a few years ago, but did not pay too much attention to the LLM application -- until ChatGPT happens. I guess many people are like me. Then I started learning how to use LLM to help with my work and my daily life. However, every post on this blog is hand-crafted by me personally, without using AI. I see my own words as a form of my existence and I would rather show the authentic side of myself, even if it is imperfect.

# Excersice regularly
Going to Pilates classes, twice a week.
I used to go to yoga class every week but I stopped doing it during Covid-19. Now I go with P every week to this Pilates class which has the reformer and ropes. It is quite effective for training those small muscles.  

Going to gym, at least once a week.
P and I also signed up for the gym membership. I was planning to use the swimming pool but it is constantly very crowded. I ended up just do the treadmill and go to some group fitness classes.
