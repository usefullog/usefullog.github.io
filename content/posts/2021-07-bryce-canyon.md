My fisrt ever photo of Milky Way was captured using an iPhone 12 Pro Max. Bryce Canyon National Park is one of the [International Dark Sky](https://darksky.org/) location. I attended a ranger hosted stargazing program and luckily the sky was very clear and dark. It was very challenging to shoot with a long exposure time and I did not have a tripod with me. I had to hold the phone against a car to stablize it. The photo turns out quite satisfactory. You can see the Milky Way running through the Summer Triangle, with Vega on the top of this photo.

Bryce Canyon has spectacular rock formation in red color. I was able to take a short hike down the Navajo Loop trail and it was very enjoyable.  
Bryce Canyon City is a small town outside the park for lodging and food. There were not a lot of food choices but I liked the beef stew at the Ruby's Inn Cowboy's Buffet & Steak Room.
