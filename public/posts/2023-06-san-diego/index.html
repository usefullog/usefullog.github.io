In San Diego I finally bought my first artwork while I was on the road. I met the artist Deb Gargula and had a brief conversation with her at the Spanish Village Art Center in Balboa Park. I loved the delicate color pencil drawings of Arizona cactus desert landscape.

In addition to the art studios, the architecture of the museum buildings and the landscape design are outstanding.\nI was on a constant search for great tacos since I moved to the West Coast. Without doing any research, I decided to try the taco restaurant right across the street from my hotel. Tacos El Gordo in Downtown San Diego is very busy.

<p>Before I visited this city, I have been hearing good thing about San Diego. The perfect weather, good food, and fun activities. One thing I did not know before my trip, is that it is also an old city. In fact, the Old Town San Diego is referred to as the &ldquo;birthplace&rdquo; of California.
