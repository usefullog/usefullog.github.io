      <description>Coffee on top of Tapei 101 My friend introduced me to Simple Kaffa in Taipei. The brand was established by Wu after he won the World Barista Championship in 2016. Simple Kaffa offers gourmet coffee beans from rare source in small batches. Most interestingly, it serves coffee that is grown locally in Taiwan.
Simple Kaffa has multiple locations, and this one - Simple Kaffa Sola - is on the 88th floor of Taipei 101.</description>
